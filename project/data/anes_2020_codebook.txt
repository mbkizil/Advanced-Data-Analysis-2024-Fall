Four years ago, in 2016, Hillary Clinton ran on the Democratic ticket against Donald Trump for the Republicans. We talk to many people who tell us they did not vote. And we talk to a few people who tell us they did vote, who really did not. We can tell they did not vote by checking with official government records. What about you? If we check the official government voter records, will they show that you voted in the 2016 presidential election, or that you did not vote in that election?

Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the person and that you don't care too much for that person. You would rate the person at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward the person.

INTRO POST-ELECTION POLITICAL FIGURE THERMOMETERS
I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our politicalleaders and other people who are in the news these days.I'll read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate thatperson using something we call the feeling thermometer.
Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the person and that you don't care too much for that person. You would rate the person at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward the person.
If we come to a person whose name you don't recognize, youdon't need to rate that person. Just tell me and we'll move on to the next one.

Question

The next set of questions uses the same thermometer scale which you used earlier in the interview. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the group. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the group and that you don't care too much for that group. You would rate the group at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward the group.
On the feeling thermometer scale of 0 to 100, how would you rate Asian-Americans?

INTRO STEREOTYPE HARDWORKING
Now we have some questions about different groups in our society. We're going to describe a seven-point scale on which the characteristics of the people in a group can be rated. In the first


statement a score of '1' means that you think almost all of the people in that group tend to be 'hard-working.' A score of '7' means that you think most people in the group are 'lazy.' A score of '4' means that you think that most people in the group are not closer to one end or the other, and of course, you may choose any number in between.

INTRO HEALTH INSURANCE ISSUE
There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital costs.
Some people feel there should be a government insurance plan which would cover all medical and hospital expenses for everyone. Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.
Others feel that all medical expenses should be paid by individuals through private insurance plans like Blue Cross or other company paid plans. Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7. And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Question

What is the best way to deal with the problem of urban unrest and rioting?
Some say it is more important to use all available force to maintain law and order, no matter what results.
Others say it is more important to correct the problems of racism and police violence that give rise to the disturbances. And, of course, other people have opinions in between.
Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought much about this?

The interview length was calculated from the interview session and audit trail data provided by our data collection vendor.
However, the source data from the vendor did not contain complete records for all interview cases, and thus the interview length could not be calculated ("-4. Technical error") or was very short in several cases. See also ANES 2020 Time Series Study: Question-Level Timing Data.
